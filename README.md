# Tick Tock

Tick Tock is a tool for helping a speaker know how much time they have left for
their talk. Tick Tock can be used on a PC, smartphone or tablet.

## Branding

If you're hosting an event and want to use Tick Tock you can fork this
repository and drop your logo into the HTML on the `gh-pages` branch. For an
example see [the Github-branded example](http://gshutler.github.com/ticktock/github.html) ([code](https://github.com/gshutler/ticktock/blob/gh-pages/github.html#L28)).
Replace the URL of the octocat and your logo will be displayed in the top-right
of the timer.
